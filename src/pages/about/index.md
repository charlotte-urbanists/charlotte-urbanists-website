## Our Values

### Accessibility
Charlotte Urbanists believe that great cities are cities where people can meet their daily needs via walking or cycling in a safe and pleasant manner.
### Transportation Wealth
Charlotte Urbanists believe that great cities have transit that is prioritized over private motor vehicles, is pleasant to use, and have reliable, frequent service.
### Public Spaces
Charlotte Urbanists believe that great cities are rich in public spaces and pathways where every citizen is allowed to dwell and inhabit without expectation of payment.
### Affordable Housing
Charlotte Urbanists believe that removing barriers for dense, multi-family housing is an essential element in the path to providing Charlotteans with affordable, flexible housing through both private and public methods.
